                        Leighla-Marie “Leigh” Dantes is an American software engineer best known for winning the 2021
                        Congressional App Challenge with mental and physical health app “Olive”. Born in Brooklyn, NY in
                        2006, Dantes took a liking to computer science when she was just 10 years old in public school
                        using Scratch by MIT. She would go on to create small projects and enjoy robotics, until she
                        moved to Connecticut in May 2021 at the end of her freshman year in high school. In October
                        2021, her and a classmate competed in and won the Congressional App Challenge for Connecticut’s
                        third district with a customizable mental and physical health app “Olive”. The app was made
                        entirely with MIT App Inventor and is a prototype for a project that will soon be released.
                        Following the Challenge, she was invited by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro to intern at her office
                        and began her internship in September 2023. Dantes began attending Howard University as a
                        computer science major and biology minor in August 2024 and became a CodePath Android App
                        Developer in January 2025. After her freshman year of college, Dantes began her internship at
                        Carillon Technologies, an aerospace company that specializes in phased array antennas. She led
                        the company’s software engineering department and became both Python and Java certified as an
                        engineer. Dantes is set to be an intern for Eli Lilly and Co. in the summer of 2026. She is
                        currently creating her own projects with Android Studio, while also
                        vigorously pursuing her studies.

                    <td style="font-size:large" class="align-middle text-center">Leigh Dantes is a Democrat. As she was
                        growing up, Leigh Dantes
                        was offered a lot of opportunities to express herself as a young programmer and person
                        interested in technology; she participated in robotics club, tech challenges, and took as many
                        computer-related classes as possible. However, as she got older, she realized that most other
                        schools didn't have nearly as many resources. In general, a person's success and thought process
                        greatly depends on where they were raised. This includes the behaviors they inherit as a result
                        of their environment, what they consume physically/mentally, and the amount of resources they
                        have access to. Dantes believes that the government has a civic duty to provide equal
                        opportunities to its people, and they should be free to take advantage of these opportunities as
                        they see fit.</td>

                    <td style="font-size: large;" class="align-middle text-center">In every nonfiction piece Dantes writes, she considers what is
                        the main problem at hand. To follow, she also considers how an event illustrates, perpetuates,
                        or solves the problem. To be a successful engineer, one must be able to find a problem and break
                        it down into parts, understanding and conveying the scope of each issue and ways to solve it.
                        This is how Dantes approaches her writing; in a way that can break down a subject and put it on
                        display to be comprehended and to eventually take action. With each piece of writing, Dantes
                        hopes to bring clarity, context, and concrete solutions to the world around her.
